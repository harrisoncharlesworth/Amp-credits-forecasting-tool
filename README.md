# 🚀 Amp Usage Growth Model

> **Predict the future, plan for success.** A powerful forecasting tool that transforms AI adoption data into actionable budget insights.

Transform your AI spend planning from guesswork into data-driven strategy. This interactive tool helps teams model growth scenarios, forecast costs, and make informed decisions about Amp usage scaling.

## ✨ Key Features

🎯 **Smart Forecasting**  
Real-time growth projections with intelligent scenario modeling

📊 **Interactive Dashboard**  
Live charts and metrics that update as you adjust parameters

⚙️ **Configurable Baselines**  
Set custom starting metrics (users, spend, lines changed) to match your reality

🔬 **Multiple Scenarios**  
Conservative, moderate, and aggressive growth predictions with confidence intervals

📈 **Dynamic Visualizations**  
Beautiful charts showing usage growth and cost distribution trends

🎛️ **Parameter Controls**  
Fine-tune projections with intuitive sliders and instant feedback

## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. **Set Your Baseline** 📋
Start with your current metrics or use the default values:
- Active Users
- Total Monthly Spend
- Lines of Code Changed

### 2. **Configure Growth Parameters** 🎚️
Adjust the sliders to model your growth scenario:
- **Target Users**: Scale from 100 to 1,000 users
- **Growth Period**: Plan for 3-24 months ahead  
- **Usage Intensity**: Factor in power users (0.5x to 2.0x multiplier)

### 3. **Analyze Scenarios** 🔍
View three distinct forecasting models:
- **🐌 Conservative**: Gradual adoption, lower risk
- **🚀 Moderate**: Balanced growth, most likely outcome
- **🔥 Aggressive**: Rapid scaling, capacity planning

### 4. **Make Informed Decisions** 💡
Use confidence intervals and statistical projections to plan budgets and resources
