### Growth Model Dashboard
The main dashboard shows current metrics and growth projections across three scenarios.

### Configure Baseline
Easily adjust starting parameters to see how different baselines affect projections.

## Usage

1. Open `amp_growth_model (1).html` in your browser
2. Use the "Growth Model" tab to view projections
3. Switch to "Configure Baseline" to adjust starting metrics:
   - Active Users
   - Total Spend ($)
   - Lines Changed
4. Click "Apply & Return" to see updated projections
5. Adjust growth parameters using the sliders:

## Scenarios

### üêå Conservative Scenario
- Assumes gradual adoption with 70% of current usage intensity
- Lower risk projections for budget planning

### üöÄ Moderate Scenario  
- Balanced growth with current usage patterns maintained
- Most likely scenario based on current trends

### üî• Aggressive Scenario
- High adoption with 130% usage intensity (power users)
- Upper bound projections for capacity planning

## Methodology

- **Baseline Metrics**: Current active users, total spend, and lines changed
- **Growth Distribution**: Based on Pareto principle (20% of users generate 80% of usage)
- **Usage Patterns**: Maintains correlation between lines changed and spend
- **Confidence Intervals**: ¬±20% margin based on observed usage variance
